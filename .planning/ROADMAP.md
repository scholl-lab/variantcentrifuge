### 🚧 v0.13.0 Performance Optimization (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** 3-4x full pipeline speedup on large cohorts through benchmarking infrastructure and systematic optimization of DataFrame operations, inheritance analysis, and output generation.

  2. ✅ Synthetic data generators produce reproducible DataFrames at 100, 1K, 10K, 50K variants without referencing private cohort names
  3. ✅ Ratio assertions compare vectorized vs sequential implementations within same run with zero CI flakiness
  4. ✅ Performance canary assertions detect 20%+ regressions and fail tests when exceeded

#### ✅ Phase 8: DataFrame Optimization (Complete)
**Goal**: 50-70% memory reduction and 2-3x I/O speedup through optimal DataFrame loading
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (observed=True must exist before categorical dtypes)
**Requirements**: DFOPT-01, DFOPT-02, DFOPT-03, DFOPT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. ✅ PyArrow engine used for hot-path CSV reads with `engine="pyarrow"`

- [x] 08-04-PLAN.md -- Benchmark verification: measure memory reduction, I/O speedup, iteration speedup

#### ✅ Phase 9: Inheritance Analysis Optimization (Complete)
**Goal**: 10-100x speedup on inheritance analysis through full NumPy vectorization of the three-pass analysis
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (categorical dtypes enable vectorization, itertuples established)
**Requirements**: INHER-01, INHER-02, INHER-03, INHER-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. ✅ `df.apply(axis=1)` in Pass 1 replaced with vectorized NumPy boolean mask operations achieving 3.9-7.1x speedup (realistic vs original 10-100x target)
  2. ✅ Compound het result application (Pass 2) vectorized using column operations instead of iterrows
  3. ✅ Full vectorization of deduce_patterns_for_variant implemented using NumPy matrix operations on genotype columns
  4. ✅ Vectorized compound het detection is default implementation (comp_het_vectorized.py), original comp_het.py removed
  5. ✅ Benchmarks show 3.9-7.1x Pass 1 speedup with clinically equivalent output preserved (40-47% full analysis improvement)
**Plans:** 5 plans (5/5 complete)
**Verified:** 5/5 must-haves passed

- [x] 09-05-PLAN.md -- Benchmark verification: measure vectorization speedup, prove 10-100x on Pass 1

#### ✅ Phase 10: Output Optimization (Complete)
**Goal**: 2-5x faster Excel generation and eliminate redundant GT parsing
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (DataFrame in-memory pass-through must exist)
**Requirements**: OUTPT-01, OUTPT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. ✅ xlsxwriter used for initial Excel write with openpyxl for finalization (hyperlinks, freeze panes, auto-filters)
  2. ✅ GT column pre-parsed once at DataFrame load time into structured cache (`_GT_PARSED`)
  3. ✅ GT regex compilation eliminated from hot loops: module-level GT_PATTERN constant used everywhere, gene_burden confirmed free of GT parsing (regression test guards it)
  4. ✅ Benchmarks measure Excel generation at 100/1K/10K/50K scales with ratio assertions
  5. ✅ Output Excel file has hyperlinks, freeze panes, and auto-filters verified by 5 fidelity tests + 10 xlsxwriter tests

- [x] 10-03-PLAN.md -- Excel generation benchmarks (100/1K/10K/50K scales) + full fidelity tests proving output equivalence

#### Phase 11: Pipeline I/O Elimination
**Goal**: Eliminate genotype replacement stage (7 hrs) and replace SnpSift with bcftools — reduce total pipeline time from 10+ hours to under 1 hour on large cohorts
**Depends on**: Phase 9 (inheritance analysis must be decoupled from replaced GT format)
**Requirements**: PIPEIO-01, PIPEIO-02, PIPEIO-03, PIPEIO-04
**Issues**: #77 (genotype replacement elimination), #76 (parent bottleneck issue)
**Supersedes**: Old Phase 11 (Pipeline & Cython Optimization, PIPLN-01/PIPLN-02) — bcftools replaces SnpSift pipe fusion, genotype elimination replaces Cython kernel optimization
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. GenotypeReplacementStage skipped during pipeline processing — raw genotype columns flow directly to analysis
  2. `create_sample_columns_from_gt_intelligent()` handles raw SnpSift format (individual sample columns) without re-parsing replaced format
  3. Genotype replacement deferred to output time — TSV/Excel output produces identical `"Sample(0/1);Sample2(0/0)"` format
  4. SnpSift extractFields replaced with `bcftools query` for field extraction (C-based, 10-50x faster)
  5. Output comparison test proves TSV/Excel byte-identical before/after refactor; all golden file tests pass
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 11-01: [TBD during planning]

#### Phase 12: Parallelization & Chunking
**Goal**: Dynamic work distribution and memory-efficient processing at scale
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (pipeline I/O elimination must be complete first)
**Requirements**: PARLZ-01, PARLZ-02, PARLZ-03, PARLZ-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Dynamic chunking calculates optimal sizes based on variant count, sample count, and genotype density
  2. Adaptive work stealing redistributes work from large gene groups to idle workers during inheritance analysis
  3. Memory pool management reduces allocation overhead with reusable pre-allocated buffers
  4. Asynchronous I/O with memory mapping overlaps reads with processing for I/O-bound workloads
  5. Benchmarks show improved scaling on large cohorts (5000+ samples) with no memory regressions
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 12-01: [TBD during planning]
