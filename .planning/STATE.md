# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Accurate inheritance pattern deduction and variant prioritization from multi-sample VCFs with configurable gene panels, scoring models, and output formats
**Current focus:** v0.17.0 — Tech Debt Cleanup & Compound Het Parallelization

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-26 — Milestone v0.17.0 started

Progress: ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0%

Next: Define requirements → create roadmap

## Performance Metrics

**Milestone velocity (v0.16.0):**
- 6 active phases, 12 plans, 3 days (2026-02-23 → 2026-02-26)
- 62 files changed, 6,372 insertions, 2,251 deletions
- 227 new tests (2,001 → 2,228)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

(New milestone — no decisions yet)

### Architecture Invariants

- ResourceManager: initialized once in pipeline.py, shared via context.resource_manager; fallback pattern in stages for test compatibility
- R backend: parallel_safe=False; rpy2 calls only from main thread
- Binary traits: always SKATBinary — never continuous-trait SKAT on binary phenotypes
- FDR strategy: single pass on ACAT-O p-values across all genes (not per-test)
- Genotype matrix: streamed per-gene via _GenotypeMatrixBuilder (build-test-discard); peak memory O(1 gene)
- P-value computation: always through compute_pvalue() — never call Liu/Kuonen directly
- Weighted BH: weights renormalized to mean=1.0 at correction time using testable genes subset
- COAST classification: model_dir=None → hardcoded SIFT/PolyPhen; model_dir=path → formula engine
- GT Lifecycle Invariant: per-sample GEN_N__GT columns survive through all analysis stages; reconstruct_gt_column only called on local copies

### Blockers/Concerns
