# Project State

## Project Reference

Plan: 8 of 10 (across v0.16.0)
Status: In progress — Phase 34 plan 02 complete
Last activity: 2026-02-24 — Completed 34-02-PLAN.md (column name standardization _pvalue/_qvalue)

Progress: ████████░░ 80%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed (v0.16.0): 8
- Prior milestone (v0.15.0): 35 plans, 12 phases, 5 days

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Roadmap] TD-06 maps to Phase 30 (covered by CLEAN-04; same change, not double-counted)
- [Roadmap] Phase 32 groups Region Restriction + PCA Wiring (both standalone, both small)
- [Roadmap] Phase 35 depends on Phase 31 (COAST path must work before weighted COAST runs are validated)
- [Roadmap] Phase 36 last — opt-in sparse matrices have lowest urgency at 5K-sample GCKD scale
- [30-01] PCAComputationStage removed from processing_stages.py; PCA wiring belongs in Phase 32
- [30-01] test_pca.py kept (tests association/pca.py module); only TestPcaComputationStage class removed
- [30-01] ParallelCompleteProcessingStage.mark_complete no longer marks "parallel_variant_extraction" — tests updated
- [31-01] COAST-03: skip threshold changed from "any category missing" to "ALL categories missing" — matches R reference (insitro/AllelicSeries drop_empty=TRUE)
- [31-01] coast_status ('complete'/'partial'/'skipped') added to TestResult.extra for diagnostic transparency
- [31-01] GT matrix fallback order: variants_df first, then current df (variants_df preferred as it preserves pre-reconstruction state)
- [31-02] COAST classification configs use COAST_* normalized column names; classify_variants() normalizes before apply_scoring()
- [31-02] coast_classification in AssociationConfig stores absolute path (None = hardcoded logic); cli.py resolves model name to path
- [31-02] Auto-injection filters out COAST_* internal names from vcf_fields (built-in models use normalized columns, not raw VCF fields)
- [31-02] diagnostics_rows parameter added to classify_variants() — ready for Phase 35 diagnostics wiring but not yet connected to file output
- [32-01] --regions-bed CLI flag added; RegionRestrictionStage wired into GeneBedCreationStage via _intersect_with_restriction_bed
- [32-02] --pca unified flag auto-detects file path vs 'akt' tool name; --pca-file/--pca-tool are hidden deprecated aliases via dest='pca'
- [32-02] PCAComputationStage sets cfg['pca_file'] for compat with _build_assoc_config_from_context; AssociationAnalysisStage uses setdefault to not override explicit config
- [32-02] AKT cache: skip subprocess if {base_name}.pca.eigenvec already exists and is non-empty
- [33-01] Weighted BH renormalization happens at correction time (inside apply_weighted_correction), not at load time — allows reuse across different testable gene subsets
- [33-01] fdr_weight column shows NORMALIZED weights (post-renormalization), not raw file weights; column absent when --gene-prior-weights not used (backward compatible)
- [33-01] Weight loading and weighted correction stay in engine.run_all(), not AssociationAnalysisStage — engine owns all correction logic
- [33-01] write_fdr_weight_diagnostics() called from engine when both gene_prior_weights AND diagnostics_output are set
- [33-01] IHW not implemented — no flag, no stub, no error message (Python-first policy; IHW deferred to backlog)
- [34-01] create_stages_from_config() now maps perform_association, perform_gene_burden, no_stats, and igv correctly; was silently ignoring them before
- [34-01] Fisher lambda_GC in write_diagnostics() is diagnostic-only — must not be used to correct Fisher p-values (exact test, not asymptotic)
- [34-02] Association DataFrame columns use _pvalue suffix (not _p_value); corrected column is acat_o_qvalue (not acat_o_corrected_p_value)
- [34-02] SKAT-O produces skat_o_pvalue when skat_method=SKATO; generated by post-processing in engine row builder
- [34-02] Internal backend dict keys (skat_p_value in coast_python.py, burden_p_values) intentionally NOT renamed — they are backend-private

### Architecture Invariants

- R backend: parallel_safe=False; rpy2 calls only from main thread
- Binary traits: always SKATBinary — never continuous-trait SKAT on binary phenotypes
- FDR strategy: single pass on ACAT-O p-values across all genes (not per-test)
- Genotype matrix: never stored in PipelineContext (memory constraint)
- P-value computation: always through compute_pvalue() — never call Liu/Kuonen directly
- Weighted BH: weights renormalized to mean=1.0 at correction time using testable genes subset (Genovese 2006 FDR guarantee)
- Case-confidence weights: must be applied to null model (var_weights in GLM), not to residuals post-hoc
- COAST classification: model_dir=None → hardcoded SIFT/PolyPhen; model_dir=path → formula engine
- PCA stage handoff: PCAComputationStage sets context.config['pca_file'] AND marks complete with result dict; AssociationAnalysisStage reads both

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 35] Weighted SKAT phi adjustment is MEDIUM confidence — validate with permutation before shipping
- [Phase 35] diagnostics_rows in classify_variants() is ready but not wired to file output — Phase 35 should complete this
- [Phase 36] SKAT-O "single eigendecomposition" intent is ambiguous — clarify before implementing (may already be done)
- [Phase 36] Sparse matrix breakeven threshold (500K cells, <20% density) is an estimate; profile on GCKD first
