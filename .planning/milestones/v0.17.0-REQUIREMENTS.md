## v0.17.0 Requirements

### Performance

- [ ] **PERF-01**: Compound het Pass 2 eliminates GIL contention via pre-dispatch dedup, pedigree arrays, and numpy-only workers — *ABANDONED: 2x regression on real data*
- [ ] **PERF-02**: Compound het parallelization achieves measurable speedup on multi-core systems — *ABANDONED: synthetic benchmarks did not predict real-world behavior*

### Dead Code

- [x] **DEAD-01**: `stage_info.py` module deleted (509 lines, never imported)
- [x] **DEAD-02**: `--coast-backend r` choice removed from CLI (no implementation exists)
- [x] **DEAD-03**: Dead inheritance functions removed from `prioritizer.py` (5 functions)
- [x] **DEAD-04**: Dead inheritance functions removed from `analyzer.py` (4 functions)
- [x] **DEAD-05**: Redundant `--gzip-intermediates` flag fixed or removed

### Documentation

- [x] **DOCS-01**: `faq.md` references to 4 removed CLI flags corrected
- [x] **DOCS-02**: `association_testing.md` column name corrected (skat_pvalue -> skat_o_pvalue)
- [x] **DOCS-03**: `changelog.md` classic pipeline reference updated

### Cleanup

- [x] **CLEAN-01**: Stale "refactored pipeline" docstrings updated in 3 integration tests
- [x] **CLEAN-02**: Stale "original pipeline" comments updated in 3 source files
- [x] **CLEAN-03**: Missing `__all__` exports added to `stages/__init__.py`
- [x] **CLEAN-04**: Dead integration test methods removed (TestBCFToolsPrefilter, test_parallel_variant_extraction)
- [x] **CLEAN-05**: TODO(12-02) legacy chunking check resolved
- [x] **CLEAN-06**: TODO intelligent batching resolved or documented as deferred
- [x] **CLEAN-07**: TD-05 Fisher lambda_GC doc clarification addressed

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 14 of 16 requirements
**Adjusted:** None
**Dropped:** 2 (PERF-01, PERF-02) — optimization reverted after empirical evidence showed 2x regression on production-scale data. Synthetic benchmarks (1000 genes, 50 samples) showed improvement but failed to predict real-world behavior with 5000+ samples.
