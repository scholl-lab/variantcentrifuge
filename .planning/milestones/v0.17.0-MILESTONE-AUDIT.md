# v0.17.0 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v0.17.0 — Tech Debt Cleanup & Compound Het Parallelization
**Audited:** 2026-02-27
**Phases:** 38 (Codebase Cleanup), 39 (Compound Het Parallelization)

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------|
| DEAD-01: Delete `stage_info.py` | 38 | SATISFIED | File absent, zero import references |
| DEAD-02: Remove `--coast-backend r` | 38 | SATISFIED | CLI choices: `["auto", "python"]` |
| DEAD-03: Dead prioritizer functions | 38 | SATISFIED | 6 functions removed |
| DEAD-04: Dead analyzer functions | 38 | SATISFIED | 4 functions removed/renamed |
| DEAD-05: `--gzip-intermediates` fix | 38 | SATISFIED | Only `--no-gzip-intermediates` remains |
| DOCS-01: faq.md CLI flags | 38 | SATISFIED | All removed flags corrected |
| DOCS-02: skat_o_pvalue column name | 38 | SATISFIED | Both occurrences updated |
| DOCS-03: changelog classic pipeline | 38 | SATISFIED | Updated to "pipeline modes" |
| CLEAN-01: Stale test docstrings | 38 | SATISFIED | Zero matches remain |
| CLEAN-02: Stale source comments | 38 | SATISFIED | Zero matches remain |
| CLEAN-03: Missing __all__ exports | 38 | SATISFIED | 6 stages added, 37 total verified |
| CLEAN-04: Dead test methods | 38 | SATISFIED | TestParallelProcessing class removed |
| CLEAN-05: TODO legacy chunking | 38 | SATISFIED | Resolved |
| CLEAN-06: TODO intelligent batching | 38 | SATISFIED | Replaced with deferred NOTE |
| CLEAN-07: Fisher lambda_GC doc | 38 | SATISFIED | Diagnostic-only note added |
| **PERF-01: Numpy-only workers** | **39** | **UNSATISFIED** | **Reverted: 2x slower on real data (502 genes, 5125 samples)** |
| **PERF-02: Measurable speedup** | **39** | **UNSATISFIED** | **Reverted: synthetic benchmarks did not predict real-world** |

**Score: 14/16 requirements satisfied**

## Phase Verification Summary

### Phase 38: Codebase Cleanup — PASSED

- Verification: 5/5 must-haves verified
- All 15 requirements (DEAD-01–05, DOCS-01–03, CLEAN-01–07) satisfied
- `make ci-check`: 2066 passed, 0 failed
- Anti-pattern: Pre-existing integration test mock issue (out of scope)

### Phase 39: Compound Het Parallelization — REVERTED

- Verification written pre-revert showed 4/4 criteria met on synthetic data
- Real-data benchmark (GCKD: 502 genes, 5125 samples) showed 2x regression
- Full revert applied (commit `1a3875d`)
- Net surviving change: `_get_batch_size()` env var override only
- Post-mortem documented in STATE.md

## Cross-Phase Integration

Verified by integration checker (1644 tests passing):

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Dead code removal — no broken imports | CLEAN | Zero references to deleted functions across variantcentrifuge/ and tests/ |
| Phase 39 revert — no orphaned code | CLEAN | `ruff check` passes, no half-applied changes |
| `_get_batch_size()` wiring | CONNECTED | Defined at line 26, called at line 270 of parallel_analyzer.py |
| `stages/__init__.py` __all__ | VERIFIED | 37 entries, all importable, matching all concrete Stage subclasses |
| Import chain integrity | VERIFIED | All 10 key import paths connected and live |

## Tech Debt

| Source | Item | Severity |
|--------|------|----------|
| Phase 38 | `test_pipeline_with_mocked_tools.py` mocks wrong module namespace (5 integration tests ERROR) | Low — pre-existing, excluded from ci-check |
| Phase 39 | REQUIREMENTS.md traceability inconsistency (checkboxes incomplete, table says Complete) | Trivial — documentation only |

## Assessment

Phase 38 achieved its goal completely — the codebase is clean of dead code, stale docs, and minor tech debt. Phase 39 was an honest engineering attempt that failed on real-world data; the revert was correct and clean. The 2 unsatisfied performance requirements (PERF-01, PERF-02) are intentionally abandoned based on empirical evidence, not due to incomplete work.

The milestone's core value was delivered through Phase 38. Phase 39's contribution is the post-mortem lesson (always benchmark with production-scale data) and the retained benchmark script for future optimization attempts.
