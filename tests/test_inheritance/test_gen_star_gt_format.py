"""
Test inheritance analysis with GEN[*].GT field extraction format.

This tests the specific case where the field extraction includes GEN[*].GT,
which results in a single GT column with colon-separated values instead of
individual sample columns.

This is important because it's a common use case and was previously broken
until fixed in July 2025.
