# COAST Golden Reference Values

Generated by: `Rscript scripts/generate_coast_golden.R`
Requires: R with AllelicSeries package installed
Used by: tests/unit/test_coast_python_comparison.py

These are pre-computed R reference values hardcoded in the Python test file.
Re-run the R script if the AllelicSeries package version changes.

The golden values are NOT stored as files here — they are embedded as constants
in `tests/unit/test_coast_python_comparison.py` (same pattern as SKAT Phase 21).
