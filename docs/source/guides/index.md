# Practical Guides

This section provides practical guides and tutorials for common VariantCentrifuge workflows.

## Annotation Strategies

Before using VariantCentrifuge, your VCF files should be properly annotated with functional predictions and population frequency data. Our annotation guides help you:

- Choose the right annotation tools
- Configure annotation pipelines
- Optimize annotation for different analysis types
- Troubleshoot common annotation issues

## Analysis Workflows

Learn how to design and execute variant analysis workflows for different research contexts:

- Rare disease analysis with family trios
- Cancer genomics (tumor-normal, tumor-only, LOH)
- Mendelian inheritance analysis (de novo, AD, AR, X-linked, compound het)
- Cohort analysis and population genetics

## Advanced Usage

Explore advanced VariantCentrifuge features and customization options:

- Custom filter development
- Variant scoring models
- Cohort analysis workflows
- Integration with other tools
- Performance optimization

## Privacy and Data Sharing

Learn how to protect participant privacy when sharing genomic data:

- Sample pseudonymization with flexible naming schemas
- Security best practices for mapping tables
- Creating publication-ready datasets
- Reversing pseudonymization for internal use
